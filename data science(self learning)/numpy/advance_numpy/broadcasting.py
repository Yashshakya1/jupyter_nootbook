Broadcasting means performing operations between arrays of different shapes —
NumPy automatically “expands” the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one 
(without actually copying data).

b = 5
print(a+b)

'''
✅ Rule 1: If dimensions are equal → fine
✅ Rule 2: If one dimension is 1 → expand it to match the other
❌ Else: Broadcasting fails (ValueError)
