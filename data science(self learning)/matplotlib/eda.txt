🎯 EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis

Definition:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of exploring and understanding a dataset before applying any machine learning or statistical model.
👉 It’s the first and most important step in data science — where you understand what your data looks like, what’s missing, what’s wrong, and what’s interesting.

| 1️⃣ Understand the data          | What columns do we have? What types of data? |
| 2️⃣ Detect missing or wrong data | NaNs, outliers, wrong formats                |
| 3️⃣ Find patterns                | Relationships between features               |
| 4️⃣ Generate insights            | What factors affect the target variable      |
| 5️⃣ Prepare data                 | Clean and transform for model training       |
